created ? (don't remember)

note: startdate calendar round chosen 11/08/3114 BC , not 13/08/3114 BC
      (to bypass Julian - Gregorian calendar transistion)

how to use : keep both files in the same folder
             run the MC.bat file
             enter the date in format DD/MM/YYYY
             choose to see calculation (will take longer, but looks cooler)
